# ITS2-QuizGame
Quiz game for high school and college students to use to study

Problem: Traditional methods of study for college and high school level students are often monotonous, and boring, which discourages students from engaging in these methods of traditional study. This makes it harder for students to study effectively, and well, especially with the existance of disorders such as ASD and ADHD, which makes it harder for these traditional study methods to be effective for many students.

The Quiz game will be multiple choice, prompting the user to select the right answer from 3 randomly selected options plus the correct answer. The program will also a data structure holding questions and answers based on an input file, and give the user options to add/remove elements from the graph. We will also allow the user to add their own questions to the question pool, to ensure their study is personalised for them, and their required subject of focus. We also intend to make the program as intuitive and easy to use as we can, so that the user experience is the best it can possibly be.
