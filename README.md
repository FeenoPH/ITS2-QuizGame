# ITS2-QuizGame
Quiz game for high school and college students to use to study

Problem: Traditional methods of study for college and high school level students are often monotonous, and boring, which discourages students from engaging in these methods of traditional study. This makes it harder for students to study effectively, and well, especially with the existance of disorders such as ASD and ADHD, which makes it harder for these traditional study methods to be effective for many students.

The Quiz game will be multiple choice, prompting the user to select the right answer from 3 randomly selected options plus the corrent answer. The program will also build data structures holding questions and answers based on a input file, and give the user options to add/remove elements from the list.
